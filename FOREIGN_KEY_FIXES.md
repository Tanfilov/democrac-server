# Foreign Key Constraint Fixes

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing errors on the Render production server related to SQLite foreign key constraints:

```
Error processing item from Walla Knesset: SQLITE_CONSTRAINT: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed
```

These errors occurred because:

1. Foreign key constraints were enabled (`PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`) to prevent invalid data relationships
2. However, the code wasn't properly handling these constraints when inserting or updating politician mentions

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a robust set of fixes to address foreign key constraint issues across the application:

### 1. Improved `updatePoliticianMentions` Function

- **Article Existence Verification**: Added checks to verify articles exist before attempting to add politician mentions
- **Transaction Support**: Implemented full transaction support to ensure atomicity
- **Prepared Statements**: Used prepared statements instead of string concatenation for better SQL injection protection
- **Individual Inserts**: Replaced batch inserts with individual inserts with proper error handling
- **Error Recovery**: Added transaction rollback on errors to prevent partial updates

### 2. Enhanced `insertArticle` Function

- **Transaction Support**: Added full transaction support
- **Rollback on Failure**: Implemented proper error handling and rollback on failure
- **GUID-based Article Lookup**: Added verification to handle cases where articles might already exist
- **Prepared Statements**: Used prepared statements for politician mentions
- **Error Reporting**: Added detailed error logging

### 3. Better `processPoliticianDetectionBatch` Function

- **Proactive Validation**: Added upfront checks to verify article existence
- **Clearing Existing Mentions**: Properly cleared existing mentions before adding new ones
- **Detailed Result Reporting**: Added success/failure counts for better monitoring
- **Error Isolation**: Ensured errors in one article don't affect processing of others
- **Title Preview**: Added title previews in logs for easier debugging

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints are now properly enforced and respected
2. **Error Resilience**: The system can now handle and recover from errors without crashing
3. **Transactional Safety**: All database operations are wrapped in transactions for atomicity
4. **Better Error Reporting**: More detailed error reporting makes debugging easier
5. **Reduced Invalid Data**: The system prevents invalid politician mentions from being created

## Monitoring & Maintenance

The system now provides detailed logging for politician detection operations, including:

- Articles that failed processing
- Success and failure counts for batch operations
- Warnings when politicians are detected but not saved
- Transaction status reporting

These improvements ensure that even with foreign key constraints enabled, the system operates reliably and maintains data integrity throughout all politician detection operations.
