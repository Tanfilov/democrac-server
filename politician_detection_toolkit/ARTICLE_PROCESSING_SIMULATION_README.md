# Article Content for `refine-detection.js`

The `tools/refine-detection.js` script, as provided in this toolkit, needs access to the actual text content (title, description, and full content) of articles to perform its analysis. In its current conceptual form, it does not include a live database connection or a web scraper.

To make `refine-detection.js` fully operational in a standalone environment or when integrating into a new system, you will need to modify it to fetch or receive article data based on the `articleId` (or URL) provided in `tools/feedback.json`.

## Strategies for Providing Article Content:

1.  **Local File System Cache:**
    *   **Concept:** If articles can be saved as plain text or JSON files locally, `refine-detection.js` can be modified to read an article's content from a file path derived from its `articleId`.
    *   **Example:** If `articleId` is "article_123", the script could look for `test_articles/article_123.txt` or `test_articles/article_123.json`.
    *   **Feedback Modification:** `feedback.json` might need to include a `filePath` field if `articleId` isn't directly usable as a filename.

2.  **Database Connection:**
    *   **Concept:** If the articles reside in a database, `refine-detection.js` would need database client code (e.g., for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite) to connect and query for articles by ID.
    *   **Considerations:** This requires adding database driver dependencies and managing connection configurations.

3.  **API Endpoint:**
    *   **Concept:** If there's an internal API that can serve article content by ID, `refine-detection.js` can be modified to make HTTP requests (e.g., using `axios` or Node.js's built-in `http` module) to fetch the data.
    *   **Considerations:** Requires network access and handling API authentication if necessary.

4.  **Direct Object Injection (for programmatic use):**
    *   **Concept:** If `refine-detection.js`'s logic is being incorporated into a larger application, the calling code could fetch the article object itself and pass it directly to a modified version of the refinement functions.

## Placeholder in `refine-detection.js`:

The initial version of `refine-detection.js` will likely have a placeholder function like:

```javascript
async function getArticleContentById(articleId) {
  // TODO: Implement logic to fetch article content
  // For example, read from a local file, query a DB, or call an API
  console.warn(`SIMULATION: Fetching content for article ${articleId}. Implement actual fetching.`);
  // Return a simulated article object structure:
  return {
    id: articleId,
    title: "Simulated Title for " + articleId,
    description: "Simulated description content...",
    content: "Simulated full article content here. This needs to be replaced with real data."
    // Ensure this structure matches what politicianDetectionService expects.
  };
}
```

This placeholder will need to be replaced with one of the strategies above for the script to be truly effective. The accuracy of the refinement process directly depends on `politicianDetectionService.js` receiving the same rich text content that the main application uses.
