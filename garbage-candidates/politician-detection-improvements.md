# Politician Detection Algorithm Improvements

## Overview

This document details the improvements made to the politician detection algorithm, migrating the enhanced features from the test environment to production.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Robust Property Handling

- **Original Issue**: The production code relied exclusively on the `he` property which was missing for some politicians
- **Solution**: Use both `name` and `he` properties with a fallback mechanism: `const politicianName = politician.name || politician.he;`

### 2. Enhanced Position-Based Detection

- **Original Issue**: Position-based detection could produce false positives
- **Solution**: Only detect politicians by position if a partial name indicator is found nearby
- **Implementation**: 
  - Check for partial name indicators (last name, nicknames) within a context window (200 characters)
  - Only count position mentions when these indicators are present
  - Special handling for known politicians (Netanyahu/ביבי, Herzog/בוז׳י, etc.)

### 3. Improved Position Qualification Detection

- **Original Issue**: Limited detection of modifiers that change the meaning of positions
- **Solution**: Enhanced detection of qualifiers that indicate non-current positions
- **Implementation**:
  - Detection of former/previous qualifiers ("לשעבר", "הקודם", etc.)
  - Detection of future/potential qualifiers ("המיועד", "הבא", etc.)
  - Context-aware qualification parsing

### 4. Relevance Scoring System

- **Original Issue**: All detected politicians had equal weight
- **Solution**: Score detected politicians based on their prominence in the article
- **Implementation**:
  - Title mentions: 10 points per mention
  - Description mentions: 5 points per mention
  - Multiple content mentions: 1 point per mention
  - Early content mentions: 3 bonus points
  - Mentions near quotes: 2 bonus points per instance
  - Mentions in reaction contexts: 3 bonus points per instance

## Technical Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

1. Updating the detection algorithm to handle both property structures
2. Adding the partial name indicator verification for position-based detection
3. Enhancing the position modifier detection
4. Implementing the relevance scoring system to prioritize primary politicians

## Migration Strategy

1. Copy the improved detection code from the test environment
2. Update references to use the new implementation
3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing data structures
4. Add extensive logging to monitor the improved detection quality
